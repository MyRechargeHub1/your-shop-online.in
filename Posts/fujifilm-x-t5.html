                <h3>Face and Eye Detection</h3>
                <p>Face and eye detection AF works brilliantly for portraits, maintaining tack-sharp focus on the subject's eye even with shallow depth-of-field shooting at f/1.4 or wider. The system detects faces at distances and angles that defeat lesser cameras, and intelligently switches focus between subjects when multiple people appear in frame.</p>

                <h3>Animal and Bird Detection</h3>
                <p>Wildlife and bird photographers benefit from dedicated animal and bird detection modes. These specialized algorithms recognize animals' eyes and track movement, maintaining focus through complex scenes with foliage, branches, or other obstructions. Bird eye detection proves particularly impressive, locking onto small, fast-moving birds that would challenge manual focus.</p>

                <h2>Impressive Video Capabilities</h2>
                <p>While primarily positioned as a stills camera, the X-T5 delivers excellent video performance. Record 6.2K video at 30fps in 4:2:2 10-bit color internally to SD cards, or output via HDMI to external recorders for even higher-quality footage.</p>
