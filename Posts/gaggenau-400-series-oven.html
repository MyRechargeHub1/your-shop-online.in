                <h2>Introduction: Precision German Engineering</h2>
                <p>For over 330 years, Gaggenau has defined luxury in kitchen appliances. The 400 Series Oven continues this proud tradition, incorporating advanced technology developed for professional kitchens. Every component is engineered to exacting standards in Germany, ensuring decades of reliable performance and exceptional cooking results.</p>
                
                <p>What distinguishes the Gaggenau 400 Series from competitors is its unwavering commitment to precision. Professional chefs demand exact temperature control, consistent heat distribution, and reliable performance—the 400 Series delivers all three while maintaining an elegantly minimalist design that complements modern kitchen aesthetics.</p>
                
                <h2>Professional-Grade Temperature Control</h2>
                <p>The 400 Series features precision temperature control accurate to within ±1 degree Celsius. This exceptional accuracy enables delicate techniques like slow-roasting at precisely 160°F for perfect medium-rare beef, or maintaining 195°F for overnight bread proofing. The temperature range extends from 85°F to 575°F, accommodating every cooking technique from dehydrating to high-heat pizza baking.</p>
                
                <h3>Advanced Sensor Technology</h3>
                <p>Multiple temperature sensors throughout the cavity continuously monitor heat distribution. The intelligent control system adjusts heating element output in real-time, ensuring consistent temperature regardless of door openings or food load. This precision transforms challenging recipes into reliably reproducible results.</p>
                
                <h2>Full-Surface Convection System</h2>
                <p>The innovative full-surface convection system uses a sophisticated fan arrangement that generates perfectly uniform heat distribution throughout the entire 4.3 cubic foot cavity. This eliminates hot and cold spots completely, allowing you to use every rack position simultaneously without rotating pans halfway through cooking.</p>
                
                <h3>Culinary Benefits</h3>
                <p>The uniform heat distribution enables batch baking of multiple cookie sheets simultaneously, all achieving identical browning. Roasted vegetables on different racks caramelize evenly. Multi-course meals can be prepared in one oven with confidence that each dish will reach perfection at the same time.</p>
                
                <h2>14 Specialized Cooking Modes</h2>
                <p>The 400 Series offers 14 precisely calibrated cooking modes, each optimized for specific techniques. Conventional heat for traditional baking, true European convection for even cooking, bottom heat with convection for crispy pizza crusts, low-temperature cooking for sous-vide style results, and stone baking mode that simulates professional pizza ovens.</p>
                
                <h3>Innovative Cooking Programs</h3>
                <p>The intensive bake mode delivers intense bottom heat perfect for pies and tarts with crispy bottoms and delicate fillings. Gentle bake maintains low temperatures ideal for cheesecakes and custards. The automatic programs include settings for bread baking, meat roasting, and slow cooking—each developed by professional chefs and programmed for consistent results.</p>
                
                <h2>Intuitive TFT Touch Display</h2>
                <p>The large full-color TFT touch display provides intuitive control over all oven functions. The high-resolution screen displays cooking mode, current temperature, target temperature, and elapsed time clearly. Integrated meat probe temperatures appear in real-time, eliminating guesswork from roasting.</p>
                
                <h3>Smart Assistance Features</h3>
                <p>Built-in recipe assistance guides you through complex cooking techniques step-by-step. The oven automatically adjusts temperature and switches modes as needed. Automatic recipes include programming for everything from perfect prime rib to artisan bread baking, ensuring professional results even for novice cooks.</p>
                
                <h2>Premium Design and Construction</h2>
                <p>The 400 Series exemplifies Gaggenau's minimalist design philosophy. The flush-mounted glass door integrates seamlessly with surrounding cabinetry. Stainless steel handle features subtly recessed grip with metallic finish that resists fingerprints. Every detail reflects meticulous German craftsmanship.</p>
                
                <h3>Build Quality</h3>
                <p>The cavity features heavy-gauge stainless steel construction with reinforced hinges rated for hundreds of thousands of cycles. Triple-glazed door maintains exterior temperatures safe to touch while retaining heat efficiently. Telescopic racks extend fully and support up to 55 pounds, ensuring safe handling of heavy roasting pans.</p>
                
                <h2>Self-Cleaning Technology</h2>
                <p>The pyrolytic self-cleaning system heats the oven to 900°F, reducing food residue to fine ash that wipes away effortlessly. This high-temperature cleaning eliminates harsh chemicals while achieving superior results. The process takes 2-3 hours depending on soiling level, after which the oven cavity looks factory-new.</p>
                
                <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
                <p>Despite its premium performance, the 400 Series achieves excellent energy efficiency. Superior insulation minimizes heat loss, reducing energy consumption during extended cooking sessions. The efficient heating elements reach target temperature quickly, further reducing energy waste. The oven has earned Energy Star certification for its efficiency.</p>
                
                <h2>Benefits for Home Chefs</h2>
                
                <h3>Consistent Professional Results</h3>
                <p>The 400 Series eliminates the guesswork from cooking. Precise temperature control ensures recipes turn out perfectly every time. Whether you're baking delicate soufflés, slow-roasting meat, or crafting artisan bread, the oven provides the control professional chefs demand.</p>
                
                <h3>Time Savings</h3>
                <p>The uniform heat distribution enables cooking multiple dishes simultaneously without compromise. Prepare entire holiday dinners in one oven with confidence. The fast preheat function brings the oven to temperature in minutes, eliminating extended waiting.</p>
                
                <h3>Culinary Creativity</h3>
                <p>The versatile cooking modes encourage experimentation with advanced techniques. Try low-temperature overnight cooking for incredibly tender brisket. Bake authentic Neapolitan-style pizza with stone baking mode. The oven's capabilities inspire you to expand your culinary repertoire.</p>
