                <h2>Massive 60,000 BTU Cooking Power</h2>
                <p>The Summit S-670 delivers extraordinary cooking power through six stainless steel burners totaling 60,000 BTU across the main cooking area. This substantial heat output enables rapid preheating, high-temperature searing, and consistent heat distribution across the expansive cooking surface.</p>

                <p>The six-burner configuration provides exceptional flexibility. Run all burners for maximum heat when cooking for crowds, or use individual burners for precise temperature zones when preparing diverse foods simultaneously. The independent burner control enables three-zone cooking: high direct heat for searing steaks, medium indirect for chicken, and low warming zone for finished items.</p>

                <h3>Rapid Preheating</h3>
                <p>The substantial BTU output enables the grill to reach 500°F+ temperatures in approximately 10-15 minutes – essential for achieving proper sear on steaks and enabling spontaneous cooking without lengthy preheating waits. This rapid heat-up means you spend less time waiting and more time cooking.</p>

                <h2>Expansive 624 Square Inch Cooking Area</h2>
                <p>The primary cooking grates provide 624 square inches of space – sufficient for simultaneously grilling 30+ burgers, 8 whole chickens, or 12 full racks of ribs. This massive capacity makes the S-670 ideal for large gatherings, parties, and serious outdoor entertaining.</p>

                <h3>Premium Stainless Steel Grates</h3>
                <p>Heavy-duty 9mm stainless steel rod cooking grates retain heat exceptionally well, creating beautiful sear marks and preventing food from sticking. The substantial rod diameter holds temperature better than thinner grates, improving heat transfer and cooking consistency.</p>

                <p>Stainless steel construction resists rust and corrosion far better than porcelain-coated cast iron grates that chip and degrade over time. These grates will look and perform like new for years with basic cleaning.</p>

                <h3>Warming Rack</h3>
                <p>The elevated warming rack adds 145 square inches of secondary cooking space, perfect for keeping finished items warm, slowly cooking vegetables, or toasting buns. The rack's height above primary grates provides gentle indirect heat ideal for items requiring warmth without additional cooking.</p>

                <h2>Dedicated Sear Station</h2>
                <p>The integrated 10,600 BTU sear station provides intense infrared heat exceeding 900°F – the high temperature necessary for steakhouse-quality crust formation. This dedicated zone creates restaurant-caliber sears impossible to achieve with conventional burners.</p>

                <h3>Steakhouse Results</h3>
                <p>Preheat the sear station for 10-15 minutes, then sear steaks for 2-3 minutes per side to develop deep, caramelized crust while keeping interiors perfectly medium-rare. The intense radiant heat creates the Maillard reaction that develops complex flavors and textures.</p>

                <p>Beyond steaks, use the sear station for crisping chicken skin, charring vegetables, searing tuna, or any application benefiting from extreme high heat. It's the secret weapon for professional-quality results at home.</p>

                <h2>Integrated Infrared Rotisserie System</h2>
                <p>The rear-mounted 10,600 BTU infrared rotisserie burner with heavy-duty motor handles large roasts, whole poultry, and rotisserie cooking with restaurant-quality results.</p>

                <h3>Perfect Rotisserie Cooking</h3>
                <p>The infrared burner provides even, consistent heat that slowly roasts while the rotation ensures even cooking and self-basting as juices continuously flow over the meat. Whole chickens emerge with crispy, golden skin and juicy interior. Prime rib develops perfect crust while remaining tender and rosy inside.</p>

                <p>The included rotisserie kit features heavy-duty motor, spit rod, and meat forks that handle up to 20 pounds – sufficient for whole turkeys, large prime rib roasts, or multiple chickens simultaneously. The motor rotates smoothly and reliably for hours without slowing or binding.</p>

                <h2>Integrated Smoker Box</h2>
                <p>The built-in smoker box positioned above a dedicated burner enables authentic wood smoke flavor on a gas grill. Add wood chips, ignite the smoker burner, and smoke infuses grilled foods with the complexity traditionally requiring charcoal or dedicated smokers.</p>

                <h3>Smoke-Enhanced Flavor</h3>
                <p>Hickory chips add bold BBQ flavor to ribs and brisket. Apple wood provides mild sweetness to pork and chicken. Mesquite delivers intense smokiness to beef. Cherry adds fruity notes to poultry. The integrated smoker eliminates the need for separate smoking equipment while providing the flavor depth gas grills traditionally lack.</p>

                <h2>Premium Stainless Steel Construction</h2>
                <p>The Summit S-670 is constructed almost entirely from high-grade stainless steel – the same corrosion-resistant material used in professional kitchens. The lid, control panel, side tables, and cart all feature stainless steel that maintains appearance and resists rust even in challenging coastal or humid environments.</p>

                <h3>Built to Last Decades</h3>
                <p>Weber engineers the Summit line for 20+ year lifespans with proper maintenance. The stainless steel construction, heavy-gauge materials, and commercial-quality components ensure this grill remains your outdoor cooking centerpiece for decades.</p>

                <p>The investment-grade construction justifies the premium price. While cheaper grills require replacement every 3-5 years as burners fail, grates rust, and ignition systems fail, the Summit continues performing like new through decades of heavy use.</p>

                <h2>Innovative Flavorizer Bars</h2>
                <p>Weber's patented Flavorizer bars sit between burners and cooking grates, catching drippings that vaporize into flavorful smoke. This system serves multiple purposes: adding smoky flavor, preventing flare-ups by vaporizing grease before it reaches burners, and protecting burners from corrosive grease extending their lifespan.</p>

                <h3>Flare-Up Prevention</h3>
                <p>The angled Flavorizer bars channel grease away from burner ports while vaporizing it into flavor-enhancing smoke. This dramatically reduces the dangerous flare-ups that char food and cause frustration on lesser grills. The result is better-tasting food and safer, more controlled cooking.</p>

                <h2>Snap-Jet Individual Burner Ignition</h2>
                <p>Each burner features individual electronic ignition – simply push and turn the control knob to ignite that specific burner. This reliable ignition system works consistently across all weather conditions without requiring batteries or manual lighting.</p>

                <p>If electronic ignition ever fails, each burner features manual lighting access and the grill includes a match-lighting guide. However, the Snap-Jet system proves exceptionally reliable with very few users ever needing backup ignition.</p>

                <h2>LED-Illuminated Control Knobs</h2>
                <p>High-contrast control knobs feature LED backlighting, clearly indicating which burners are active and making operation simple even during evening grilling. The visual confirmation prevents accidentally leaving burners on and improves safety.</p>

                <h2>Extensive Side Table Space</h2>
                <p>Generous stainless steel side tables flank the cooking area, providing ample space for platters, tools, serving dishes, and prep work. The tables fold down for space-saving storage, and the enclosed cart design provides additional storage beneath.</p>

                <h3>Integrated Tool Hooks</h3>
                <p>Multiple hooks on the side tables keep spatulas, tongs, and brushes within arm's reach. The thoughtful placement ensures tools remain accessible without cluttering work surfaces.</p>

                <h2>Enclosed Cabinet Storage</h2>
                <p>The enclosed stainless steel cabinet beneath the grill stores propane tank, tools, covers, and accessories while protecting them from weather. Double doors provide full access, and internal shelving organizes items efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Grease Management System</h2>
                <p>The angled grease pan channels drippings toward a removable catch pan that pulls out for easy disposal. Disposable aluminum pan liners are available, making cleanup as simple as removing and discarding the liner.</p>

                <p>This comprehensive grease management prevents accumulation that causes dangerous flare-ups and makes the messy post-cookout cleanup significantly faster and easier.</p>

                <h2>Heavy-Duty Locking Casters</h2>
                <p>Four large casters enable moving the grill for cleaning, seasonal storage, or deck rearrangement despite its substantial 250+ pound weight. The heavy-duty wheels roll smoothly across concrete, pavers, and wood decking without scuffing or marring surfaces.</p>

                <p>Locking mechanisms on two casters secure the grill firmly in position during cooking, preventing unwanted movement that would interfere with rotisserie cooking or precision grilling.</p>

                <h2>Built-In Lid Thermometer</h2>
                <p>The precision hood-mounted thermometer displays internal temperature at a glance, eliminating guesswork about heat levels. While not a replacement for probe thermometers for meat, the lid thermometer confirms grill temperature for recipes requiring specific heat ranges.</p>

                <h2>Versatile Cooking Capabilities</h2>
                <p>The S-670's comprehensive features enable virtually any outdoor cooking technique:</p>

                <h3>Direct Grilling</h3>
                <p>High-heat direct grilling for steaks, burgers, hot dogs, and vegetables. The powerful burners and heavy grates create perfect sear marks and flavorful crust.</p>

                <h3>Indirect Roasting</h3>
                <p>Turn off center burners and use outer burners to create convection roasting environment for whole chickens, pork loin, or prime rib. The enclosed hood traps heat like an oven, cooking food evenly from all sides.</p>

                <h3>Low and Slow Smoking</h3>
                <p>Use the smoker box with wood chips and low burner settings to smoke ribs, brisket, or pork shoulder for hours. While not matching dedicated smokers, the results rival many standalone smokers.</p>

                <h3>Rotisserie Cooking</h3>
                <p>The infrared rotisserie system handles whole turkeys, prime rib, leg of lamb, or multiple chickens with self-basting rotation producing restaurant-quality results.</p>

                <h3>High-Heat Searing</h3>
                <p>The dedicated sear station creates 900°F+ temperatures for steakhouse-quality crust on premium steaks.</p>

                <h2>Year-Round Grilling</h2>
                <p>The Summit's powerful burners and enclosed hood enable year-round grilling even in cold climates. Winter grilling requires slightly longer preheating and monitoring, but the substantial BTU output and insulated hood maintain cooking temperatures even when outdoor temperatures drop below freezing.</p>

                <h2>Professional Features at Home</h2>
                <p>The S-670 incorporates features typically found only in commercial outdoor kitchens:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Commercial-grade stainless steel construction throughout</li>
                    <li>Restaurant-quality rotisserie system</li>
                    <li>Dedicated infrared sear burner</li>
                    <li>Integrated smoker system</li>
                    <li>Massive cooking capacity for crowd feeding</li>
                    <li>Professional-grade burner power and control</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This professional-grade feature set transforms backyard cooking into culinary capabilities rivaling fine dining establishments.</p>

                <h2>Weber Quality and Support</h2>
                <p>Weber provides comprehensive warranty coverage: 10 years on burners, 5 years on Flavorizer bars, grates, and stainless steel components. This industry-leading warranty demonstrates Weber's confidence in construction quality and component longevity.</p>

                <h3>Customer Support</h3>
                <p>Weber's customer support assists with assembly questions, usage tips, troubleshooting, and parts ordering. Replacement parts remain available for years, enabling long-term serviceability impossible with discount brands that discontinue parts quickly.</p>

                <h2>Assembly and Setup</h2>
                <p>The S-670 requires assembly, typically taking 2-4 hours for two people. Weber provides comprehensive illustrated instructions, and numerous video tutorials demonstrate assembly steps. Many retailers offer professional assembly services for additional fees.</p>

                <h2>Operating Costs</h2>
                <p>The grill connects to standard 20-pound propane tanks (hidden in enclosed cabinet) or can be converted to natural gas with separately-purchased conversion kit. Propane consumption varies based on usage, but expect one 20-pound tank to last approximately 12-20 hours of cooking with typical mixed-heat usage.</p>

                <h2>Who Should Buy the Weber Summit S-670?</h2>

                <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
                <p>The Weber Summit S-670 stands as the finest gas grill available in 2025 for serious outdoor cooking enthusiasts. It combines professional-grade features, legendary Weber quality, and thoughtful design in a package that transforms your outdoor space into a complete cooking destination rivaling indoor kitchens.</p>

                <p>The six-burner configuration with dedicated sear station, rotisserie, and smoker provides versatility that eliminates the need for multiple grills and smokers. Whether you're searing steaks at 900°F, slow-smoking ribs for six hours, or rotisserie-roasting a whole turkey for Thanksgiving, the S-670 handles every technique with excellence.</p>

                <p>The stainless steel construction isn't cosmetic – it's the foundation for decades of reliable performance. While competitors' grills rust, corrode, and fail after 3-5 years, the Summit continues performing like new through 20+ years of regular use. The substantial warranty backing this longevity provides peace of mind rare in consumer products.</p>

                <p>At $3,599, the S-670 requires serious consideration. However, for outdoor cooking enthusiasts who grill multiple times weekly, regularly entertain guests, or simply demand the absolute best equipment, the investment proves worthwhile. Calculate cost-per-year over a 20-year lifespan (approximately $180/year), and the value proposition becomes clear – especially compared to replacing cheap grills every few years.</p>

                <p>If you're serious about outdoor cooking, value quality that lasts decades, regularly cook for groups, or want your outdoor kitchen centerpiece to be as capable and reliable as your indoor appliances, the Weber Summit S-670 is an exceptional investment that will elevate your outdoor cooking for years to come. It's not just a grill – it's the foundation of memorable meals and gatherings that become family tradition.</p>
