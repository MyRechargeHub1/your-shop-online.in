                <h2>Revolutionary Display Technology</h2>
                <p>At the heart of Vision Pro lies an extraordinary display system. Each eye is treated to a dedicated micro-OLED display packing more pixels than a 4K television into a panel the size of a postage stamp. The combined resolution of 23 million pixels delivers unprecedented clarity, making text readable and images stunningly lifelike.</p>
                <p>The displays feature wide color gamut support, high dynamic range, and an impressive refresh rate that eliminates motion blur. A custom three-element lens system projects these displays directly to your eyes with minimal distortion, creating an expansive field of view that feels natural and immersive.</p>
                <h3>EyeSight Feature</h3>
                <p>Apple's innovative EyeSight technology addresses a key concern with VR headsets: social isolation. When someone approaches while you're wearing Vision Pro, the external OLED display reveals your eyes, allowing natural eye contact. When fully immersed in content, EyeSight shows a visual indicator that you're engaged.</p>
                <h2>Design and Comfort</h2>
                <p>Vision Pro showcases Apple's design mastery with a curved laminated glass front, aluminum frame, and premium materials throughout. The device weighs approximately 600-650 grams depending on accessories, distributed across an adjustable headband system.</p>
                <h3>Fit System</h3>
                <p>The modular design includes interchangeable Light Seal cushions that block ambient light while ensuring comfort. Multiple sizes accommodate different face shapes. The Solo Knit Band provides adjustable cushioning, while the optional Dual Loop Band offers additional support for extended use sessions.</p>
                <p>The headset accommodates prescription lenses through ZEISS Optical Inserts, ensuring users with vision correction can experience Vision Pro at full clarity without wearing glasses underneath.</p>
                <h2>Revolutionary Input Methods</h2>
                <h3>Eye Tracking</h3>
                <p>Vision Pro's eye tracking system is remarkably precise, using infrared cameras and LED illuminators to track both eyes with near-zero latency. Simply looking at an item selects it - the cursor becomes your gaze. This feels natural within minutes and enables interaction speeds impossible with traditional controllers.</p>
                <h3>Hand Gestures</h3>
                <p>Cameras mounted on the bottom of the device track your hands in your lap or at your sides. Simple gestures - tap fingers together to select, pinch and move to scroll, flick to swipe - become second nature quickly. There's no need to raise your arms or wave them around; subtle movements are sufficient.</p>
                <h3>Voice Control</h3>
                <p>Siri integration enables voice commands for navigation, dictation, and app control. The combination of eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice creates a fluid interaction model that feels more intuitive than any previous computing paradigm.</p>
                <h2>Spatial Computing in Action</h2>
                <h3>Infinite Desktop</h3>
                <p>Vision Pro transforms any physical space into an infinite canvas. Place app windows anywhere in your environment - floating beside your desk, on the wall, or suspended in space. Multiple windows can be arranged precisely, creating a multi-monitor setup without physical limitations.</p>
                <h3>Immersive Environments</h3>
                <p>When you need to focus or escape, Environments transport you to stunning locations - from serene mountaintops to moonlit deserts. The Digital Crown adjusts immersion levels, allowing you to gradually fade out physical reality or maintain awareness of your surroundings.</p>
                <h3>Spatial Photos and Videos</h3>
                <p>The built-in 3D camera captures spatial photos and videos that, when viewed later on Vision Pro, recreate moments with remarkable depth and presence. Family gatherings, travels, and everyday memories become immersive experiences you can revisit.</p>
                <h2>Entertainment Experience</h2>
                <h3>Apple TV+ and Movies</h3>
                <p>Vision Pro transforms movie watching into a cinematic experience. The virtual screen can expand to the equivalent of a 100-foot display in a personal theater environment. Spatial Audio creates an immersive soundscape that responds to your head movements. Apple TV+ content, including 3D movies, looks spectacular.</p>
                <h3>Gaming</h3>
                <p>Apple Arcade games are optimized for Vision Pro, with select titles offering immersive spatial experiences. While not designed for intense gaming like dedicated VR headsets, Vision Pro excels at casual gaming and board game experiences that blend with your environment.</p>
                <h3>Sports and Events</h3>
                <p>Watching sports on Vision Pro is transformative. Imagine a baseball game displayed on a giant screen in your living room, with multiple picture-in-picture windows showing different camera angles. Apple is expanding immersive sports content, promising stadium-like experiences from home.</p>
                <h2>Productivity and Work</h2>
                <h3>Mac Virtual Display</h3>
                <p>Vision Pro can display your Mac's screen as a virtual monitor - an enormous, high-resolution display floating in space. This extends your Mac's desktop without additional hardware, perfect for developers, designers, and anyone needing expansive screen real estate.</p>
                <h3>Native Apps</h3>
                <p>Productivity apps like Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and Safari are redesigned for spatial computing. Documents and presentations can be manipulated in three dimensions. Web browsing feels expansive on a massive floating display. Compatible iPhone and iPad apps run seamlessly in Vision Pro.</p>
                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                <p>FaceTime on Vision Pro creates life-sized Personas of call participants, arranged spatially around you. Screen sharing in meetings allows collaborative document review. This represents a compelling future for remote work, though the technology is still maturing.</p>
                <h2>Hardware Specifications</h2>
                <h3>Processing Power</h3>
                <p>Vision Pro is powered by Apple's M2 chip handling the main computing tasks and the revolutionary R1 chip processing sensor data with virtually no latency. The R1 streams new images to displays within 12 milliseconds, maintaining the seamless reality-blending that prevents motion sickness.</p>
                <h3>Battery and Power</h3>
                <p>The external battery pack provides approximately 2-2.5 hours of general use, connecting via a proprietary cable. The device can be used while charging for unlimited sessions. The battery design keeps weight off your head but requires managing the cable.</p>
                <h3>Audio</h3>
                <p>Dual-driver audio pods positioned near each ear deliver personalized Spatial Audio. The speakers are remarkably effective, producing rich, directional sound without isolating you from your environment. For privacy or maximum immersion, AirPods Pro integrate seamlessly with head tracking.</p>
