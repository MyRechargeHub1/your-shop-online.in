                <h2>Revolutionary 33-Megapixel Full-Frame Sensor</h2>
                <p>The Sony A7 IV features a newly developed 33-megapixel Exmor R BSI CMOS sensor that strikes the perfect balance between resolution and low-light performance. This sweet spot resolution provides enough detail for large prints and significant cropping while maintaining excellent high ISO performance that professional photographers demand.</p>
                <p>The back-illuminated sensor design improves light-gathering efficiency, resulting in cleaner images at elevated ISOs. Native ISO range extends from 100 to 51,200, expandable to ISO 50-204,800 for extreme situations. At ISO 6400, images remain remarkably clean with minimal noise, while ISO 12,800 is still usable for professional work with minor noise reduction.</p>
                <h3>Exceptional Dynamic Range</h3>
                <p>Dynamic range performance is outstanding, capturing approximately 15 stops of latitude in optimal conditions. This exceptional range allows you to recover extreme highlights and lift deep shadows without introducing excessive noise or banding. Shooting in challenging lighting—backlit portraits, sunset landscapes, or high-contrast interiors—becomes significantly easier.</p>
                <p>The 14-bit RAW files contain tremendous color and tonal information. In post-processing, you can push files aggressively to recover blown highlights or reveal shadow detail that appears completely black in the JPEG preview. This flexibility gives photographers confidence to shoot in difficult lighting knowing they can rescue the image later.</p>
                <h3>Advanced Image Processing</h3>
                <p>The latest BIONZ XR image processor delivers 8x faster processing than previous generations, enabling features like 10fps continuous shooting, advanced computational photography modes, and real-time image processing with minimal lag. The processor handles the 33MP sensor output effortlessly while maintaining responsive camera operation.</p>
                <p>Image quality straight out of camera is excellent with natural colors, pleasing contrast, and well-controlled noise. Sony's color science has improved dramatically, producing skin tones that look natural without heavy post-processing. The Creative Style and Picture Profile options provide extensive control over the look of your images.</p>
                <h2>Cutting-Edge Real-Time Autofocus</h2>
                <p>The A7 IV inherits Sony's groundbreaking Real-time Eye AF and Real-time Tracking AF technologies from higher-end models. The autofocus system uses 759 phase-detection points covering approximately 94% of the frame, ensuring accurate focus regardless of subject position.</p>
                <h3>Human and Animal Eye Detection</h3>
                <p>Real-time Eye AF for humans works brilliantly, locking onto eyes instantaneously and maintaining focus even as subjects move erratically. The system recognizes and tracks eyes behind glasses, in profile, or when partially obscured. For portrait photographers, this technology is transformative—you can concentrate on composition and expression while the camera handles critical focus.</p>
                <p>Animal Eye AF extends this capability to pets and wildlife. The camera recognizes and tracks eyes of dogs, cats, and birds with impressive reliability. Wildlife photographers will appreciate the ability to track birds in flight with sustained accuracy, something that was extremely challenging with older autofocus systems.</p>
                <h3>Real-Time Tracking</h3>
                <p>Real-time Tracking uses artificial intelligence to identify and follow subjects across the frame. Simply position your focus point on the subject, half-press the shutter, and the camera maintains focus as the subject moves through the scene. The tracking works for people, animals, and vehicles with remarkable tenacity.</p>
                <p>The AF system performs exceptionally well in low light, functioning down to -4 EV—equivalent to moonlight conditions. Combined with the bright f/1.4 or f/1.8 prime lenses, you can achieve accurate autofocus in scenarios where manual focusing would be nearly impossible.</p>
                <h2>Professional 4K Video Capabilities</h2>
                <p>The A7 IV is Sony's most capable hybrid camera for video production.

                <h3>Advanced Video Features</h3>
                <p>Professional videographers will appreciate the extensive codec options. Record in XAVC S-I (intra-frame) for maximum editing flexibility at up to 600Mbps, or use Long GOP compression for longer recording times while maintaining excellent quality. Support for 10-bit 4:2:2 internal recording provides superior color grading latitude.</p>
                <p>S-Log3 and S-Gamut3 profiles offer cinematic dynamic range for professional color grading. HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma) provides HDR video that displays correctly on compatible monitors without grading. Multiple frame rate options including 24p, 25p, 30p, 50p, and 60p accommodate international standards and creative slow-motion effects.</p>
                <h3>Enhanced Stabilization and Focus</h3>
                <p>In-body 5-axis image stabilization provides up to 5.5 stops of compensation, enabling handheld video recording with gimbal-like smoothness. Active Mode stabilization crops slightly for even more stable footage when walking or moving dynamically. The breathing compensation feature (with compatible lenses) digitally corrects focus breathing for professional-looking rack focuses.</p>
                <p>Face and Eye AF work seamlessly in video mode, maintaining critical focus on subjects throughout recordings. Touch tracking lets you tap the screen to designate which subject to follow, perfect for run-and-gun documentary work or vlogging.</p>
                <h2>Refined Ergonomics and Build Quality</h2>

                <p>The Sony A7 IV is the ultimate hybrid camera for photographers and videographers who refuse to compromise. It masterfully balances high-resolution photography with professional video capabilities, making it genuinely versatile for diverse creative work. This isn't a camera with weaknesses in certain areas—it excels at everything.</p>
                <p>The 33-megapixel sensor hits the sweet spot for resolution, providing enough detail for commercial work while maintaining excellent high ISO performance. The 15-stop dynamic range ensures you can shoot in challenging lighting with confidence. Image quality is simply stunning, with natural colors and exceptional detail that stands up to rigorous professional standards.</p>
                <p>Autofocus performance is extraordinary. Real-time Eye AF for humans and animals works so reliably that you'll wonder how you ever shot portraits or wildlife without it. The tracking tenacity means fewer missed shots and more time focusing on creative aspects rather than technical challenges.</p>
                <p>Video capabilities elevate the A7 IV into professional territory. Internal 10-bit 4:2:2 recording at 4K 60p provides flexibility for color grading, while the extensive codec options accommodate various workflows. The combination of advanced AF, excellent stabilization, and professional audio inputs makes this a complete video production tool.</p>
                <p>Build quality inspires confidence with weather sealing suitable for challenging environments. The dual card slots provide essential redundancy for professional work. Battery life is respectable, and USB-C charging adds flexibility for extended shooting sessions.</p>
                <p>Yes, the A7 IV is expensive. However, this is a professional tool that can serve as your primary camera for years. The versatility means you potentially need fewer specialized cameras—one body handles portraits, landscapes, weddings, commercial work, and video production with equal competence. For serious photographers and hybrid content creators, the Sony A7 IV represents one of the best investments in full-frame imaging technology.</p>
