                <h2>Sony's Audio Heritage Perfected</h2>
                <p>Sony has been crafting audio equipment for over 75 years, and that expertise shines through in the WF-1000XM6. These earbuds incorporate technology refined across Sony's entire product line, from their legendary headphones to professional studio monitors. The result is earbuds that satisfy audiophiles while remaining accessible to everyday users.</p>
                <p>The XM6 generation represents a significant leap over the already excellent XM5. Sony has improved virtually every aspect: smaller, lighter design; better noise cancellation; superior sound quality; and smarter features. It's the most refined wireless earbud Sony has ever produced.</p>
                <h2>Industry-Leading Noise Cancellation</h2>
                <h3>V3 Integrated Processor</h3>
                <p>The new V3 Integrated Processor delivers Sony's most advanced noise cancellation yet. It analyzes ambient noise 700 times per second, generating precise anti-noise that blocks up to 25% more sound than the XM5. In real-world testing, the XM6 matches or exceeds the best over-ear headphones for noise reduction.</p>
                <p>The processor handles low-frequency rumble like airplane engines and trains exceptionally well, but also significantly reduces mid-frequency sounds like office chatter and city traffic. The result is a cocoon of silence that makes focus possible anywhere.</p>
                <h3>Multi-Microphone System</h3>
                <p>Each earbud contains multiple microphones dedicated to noise cancellation. Outward-facing microphones capture ambient sound, while inward-facing microphones analyze what reaches your ear. This feedback system ensures precise noise cancellation regardless of fit variations.</p>
                <h3>Adaptive Sound Control</h3>
                <p>Adaptive Sound Control automatically adjusts noise cancellation based on your activity and location. The Sony Headphones Connect app learns your patterns and can automatically apply optimal settings for places you frequent. Walking on a busy street? Ambient sound enables. Arriving at the office? Noise cancellation maximizes.</p>
                <h2>Exceptional Sound Quality</h2>
                <h3>Custom Dynamic Driver</h3>
                <p>The 8.4mm Dynamic Driver X delivers Sony's signature sound: detailed, musical, and emotionally engaging. The driver uses a newly developed diaphragm dome that reproduces high frequencies with exceptional clarity while the edge structure delivers powerful, controlled bass.</p>
                <h3>LDAC High-Resolution Audio</h3>
                <p>LDAC codec support transmits up to 990kbps of data, nearly three times the bandwidth of standard Bluetooth codecs. With a compatible Android device and high-resolution audio files, the XM6 delivers sound quality approaching wired connections. Apple users benefit from AAC codec support with excellent quality.</p>
                <h3>DSEE Extreme</h3>
                <p>Sony's DSEE Extreme AI upscaling restores compressed audio in real-time. Even streaming services and compressed files benefit, with the processor intelligently rebuilding lost frequencies and dynamics. The difference is audible, making everyday music sound fuller and more detailed.</p>
                <h3>360 Reality Audio</h3>
                <p>For compatible content, 360 Reality Audio creates an immersive soundscape around you. Music feels three-dimensional, with instruments placed in specific locations in space. Head tracking makes the experience even more convincing. While content is still limited, experiencing a 360 Reality Audio mix is genuinely impressive.</p>
                <h2>Design and Comfort</h2>
                <h3>Smaller and Lighter</h3>
                <p>Sony has significantly reduced the size and weight of the XM6. Each earbud weighs just 5.9 grams - roughly 10% lighter than the XM5. The more compact design fits more ears comfortably, and the reduced weight minimizes fatigue during extended listening sessions.</p>
                <h3>Ergonomic Shape</h3>
                <p>The rounded, organic shape nestles securely in the ear without pressure points. Sony analyzed thousands of ear shapes to optimize the design. Four sizes of noise isolation eartips ensure a proper seal, crucial for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness.</p>
                <h3>Comfort for Extended Use</h3>
                <p>During multi-hour testing sessions, the XM6 remained comfortable without adjustment. The lightweight design and pressure-free fit enable all-day wear for users who need constant audio access. For exercise, the secure fit holds even during vigorous movement.</p>
                <h3>IPX4 Water Resistance</h3>
                <p>IPX4 rating protects against sweat and light rain, making the XM6 suitable for workouts and outdoor use. While not designed for swimming, they handle perspiration and brief exposure to rain without issue.</p>
                <h2>Smart Features</h2>
                <h3>Speak-to-Chat</h3>
                <p>When you start speaking, the XM6 automatically pauses music and activates ambient sound mode. Have a quick conversation without removing the earbuds or pressing buttons. When you stop talking, music resumes automatically. The feature works reliably and can be customized or disabled in the app.</p>
                <h3>Quick Attention</h3>
                <p>Place your finger on the left earbud to instantly lower volume and enable ambient sound. Perfect for announcements, quick interactions, or listening to your surroundings. Release to return to normal listening.</p>
                <h3>Touch Controls</h3>
                <p>Intuitive touch controls on each earbud handle playback, calls, and assistant activation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tap once: Play/pause, answer calls</li>
                    <li>Tap twice: Next track</li>
                    <li>Tap three times: Previous track</li>
                    <li>Touch and hold: Cycle NC modes or activate voice assistant</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All controls are fully customizable through the Sony Headphones Connect app.</p>
                <h3>Multipoint Connection</h3>
                <p>Connect to two devices simultaneously and seamlessly switch between them. Take a call on your phone while working on your laptop, then return to laptop audio without manual switching. The implementation works more reliably than most competitors.</p>
                <h2>Battery Life</h2>
                <h3>Earbuds</h3>
                <p>The earbuds deliver up to 8 hours of listening with noise cancellation enabled, or up to 10 hours with ANC off. This is excellent for premium wireless earbuds and handles most daily scenarios without needing the case.</p>
                <h3>Charging Case</h3>
                <p>The compact charging case provides an additional 16 hours with ANC on (24 hours total) or 20 hours with ANC off (30 hours total). This handles extended trips without access to charging.</p>
                <h3>Fast Charging</h3>
                <p>Three minutes of charging provides 60 minutes of playback - enough to handle unexpected battery depletion. Full charge from empty takes approximately 1.5 hours for the earbuds, 2 hours for the case. Both wireless and USB-C charging are supported.</p>
                <h2>Call Quality</h2>
                <p>Sony has significantly improved call quality in the XM6. The beamforming microphone array with AI-based noise reduction ensures clear voice transmission even in noisy environments. Wind noise reduction helps during outdoor calls.</p>
                <p>Callers report voices sound natural and intelligible, even in challenging conditions. The bone conduction sensor detects your voice accurately, helping distinguish speech from ambient noise. Video calls, phone calls, and voice messages all benefit from these improvements.</p>
                <h2>Sony Headphones Connect App</h2>
                <p>The Sony Headphones Connect app offers extensive customization:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equalizer:</strong> Eight presets plus custom settings and manual 5-band EQ</li>
