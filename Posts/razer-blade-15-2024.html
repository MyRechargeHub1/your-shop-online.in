                <p>Yes, the Blade 15 is expensive. You can find gaming laptops with similar specifications for less money. However, those laptops won't match the build quality, portability, or refined experience Razer delivers. The premium price buys premium materials, sophisticated engineering, and attention to detail throughout. For those who can afford it and value portability alongside performance, the Razer Blade 15 2024 represents the best gaming laptop available. It's the laptop other manufacturers aspire to build—the benchmark against which all premium gaming laptops are measured.</p>
