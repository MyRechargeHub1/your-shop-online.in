The all-aluminum chassis is precision CNC-machined with an Eclipse Gray finish that appears sophisticated and understated.</p>
                <h3>Slim and Portable</h3>
                <p>Despite its powerful hardware, the Zephyrus G16 measures just 1.49cm (0.59 inches) at its thinnest point and 1.99cm (0.78 inches) at its thickest, making it one of the slimmest gaming laptops available with this level of performance. Weighing approximately 1.85kg (4.08 lbs), it's genuinely portable for daily commutes or travel.</p>
                <p>The compact footprint means the laptop fits easily in standard laptop bags and backpacks. The elegant design doesn't scream "gaming laptop," allowing you to use it professionally without the embarrassment of RGB lighting and aggressive styling.</p>
                <h3>Build Quality</h3>
                <p>The build quality is exceptional, with zero flex in the keyboard deck and a rigid display that resists twisting. The hinge mechanism is perfectly tensioned, allowing one-handed opening while keeping the display stable at any angle. Premium materials and precise manufacturing create a laptop that feels as expensive as it is.</p>
                <h2>Innovative Cooling System</h2>
