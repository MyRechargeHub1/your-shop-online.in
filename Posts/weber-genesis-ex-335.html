                <h2>Introduction: The Smart Grilling Revolution</h2>
                <p>For over 70 years, Weber has defined excellence in outdoor cooking, and the Genesis EX-335 continues that legacy while embracing modern technology. This isn't just a grill with Bluetooth—it's a complete outdoor cooking system that monitors temperatures, guides you through recipes, provides real-time alerts, and ensures perfectly cooked food every time through intelligent heat management and precision engineering.</p>
                <p>The EX-335 targets the serious home chef who demands professional results but appreciates modern convenience. Whether you're searing steaks, smoking brisket, or grilling vegetables, this grill provides the control, capacity, and capabilities to execute any outdoor cooking technique with confidence.</p>

                <h2>Key Features</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Weber Connect Smart Grilling Technology</h3>
                <p>The centerpiece of the EX-335's innovation is Weber Connect—an integrated smart system that transforms your smartphone into a grilling assistant. The system monitors food temperatures through probe sensors, provides step-by-step cooking guidance, and sends notifications when it's time to flip, remove, or serve your food. Weber Connect supports hundreds of pre-programmed recipes optimized for different foods and doneness levels, taking the guesswork out of outdoor cooking.</p>
                <p>The Weber Connect app provides real-time temperature monitoring of both your food and the grill itself. Set your desired doneness level (rare, medium, well-done), and the app calculates cooking times based on the current grill temperature and food thickness, adjusting recommendations if conditions change. Push notifications alert you at critical moments—when to flip steaks, when fish is perfectly flaky, or when chicken reaches safe temperatures.</p>

                <h3>2. PureBlu High-Performance Burner System</h3>
                <p>Weber's PureBlu burner system represents years of engineering refinement, delivering consistent heat distribution across the entire cooking surface. Three stainless steel burners produce 39,000 BTUs total—sufficient for high-temperature searing and low-and-slow smoking. The unique burner tube design ensures even flame distribution, eliminating hot and cold spots that plague lesser grills.</p>
                <p>Each burner features individual control, allowing you to create different heat zones simultaneously. Sear steaks over high heat on one side while slowly roasting vegetables on indirect heat on the other. This multi-zone capability is essential for cooking complete meals where different foods require different temperatures.</p>

                <h3>3. Premium Cooking Grates and Warming Rack</h3>
                <p>The 513 square inches of primary cooking space accommodates meals for large gatherings—comfortably fitting 25+ burgers or multiple racks of ribs. The porcelain-enameled, cast-iron cooking grates retain heat exceptionally well, creating beautiful sear marks while preventing food from sticking. The heavy grates also help maintain stable temperatures when you add cold food to the grill.</p>
                <p>Above the main grates, the included Tuck-Away warming rack provides an additional 156 square inches for keeping food warm or slow-cooking items that don't need direct heat. The rack folds down when not needed, maximizing cooking space flexibility.</p>

                <h3>4. Side Burner and Prep Surfaces</h3>
                <p>The integrated 12,000 BTU side burner functions as an outdoor stovetop, perfect for simmering sauces, sautéing vegetables, or bringing water to boil for corn or pasta. This outdoor kitchen capability means you can prepare entire meals without running back to the kitchen, keeping the chef engaged with guests while cooking.</p>
                <p>Ample prep surfaces flank both sides of the grill, providing convenient staging areas for platters, utensils, and ingredients. The durable, weather-resistant work surfaces are large enough for real meal prep, not just token ledges like budget grills offer.</p>

                <h3>5. Grease Management System</h3>
                <p>Weber's signature grease management system channels drippings away from burners to a removable catch pan, dramatically reducing flare-ups while making cleanup simple. The system's V-shaped design uses gravity to direct grease flow, and the disposable catch pan means cleaning takes seconds—just remove, dispose, and replace.</p>
                <p>The comprehensive design prevents grease buildup on critical components, extending the grill's lifespan while maintaining peak performance. This attention to practical details reflects Weber's understanding of real-world grilling challenges.</p>

                <h3>6. Premium Construction and Durability</h3>
                <p>Built from premium materials throughout, the Genesis EX-335 withstands harsh weather and years of intense use. The porcelain-enameled lid and body resist rust, fading, and peeling. Stainless steel burners, bars, and handles provide longevity and easy maintenance. Heavy-duty cart construction with locking casters ensures stability during cooking while allowing easy repositioning when needed.</p>
                <p>Weber backs the Genesis with comprehensive warranties—10 years on major components like burners and the cook box, demonstrating confidence in the grill's durability. This isn't seasonal equipment that lasts a few years; it's a long-term investment that delivers decades of exceptional cooking.</p>

                <h2>Cooking Performance</h2>
                <p>The Genesis EX-335 excels across all grilling techniques. High-temperature searing produces steakhouse-quality crusts on steaks and chops, with the cast-iron grates retaining enough heat to maintain proper searing temperatures even when adding cold food. Low-and-slow cooking for smoking ribs or brisket works beautifully with careful burner management and the grill's excellent heat retention.</p>

                <h2>Setup and Assembly</h2>

Most components arrive pre-assembled, minimizing the actual work required.</p>
                <p>Weber Connect setup is equally simple—download the app, power on the grill, and follow the pairing instructions. The system connects via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, providing reliable connectivity up to 100 feet from your grill.</p>
