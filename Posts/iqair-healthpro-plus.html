                <!-- Top Buy Button -->
<h2>HyperHEPA Filtration: Beyond Standard HEPA</h2>
                <p>The HealthPro Plus's revolutionary HyperHEPA filter exceeds standard HEPA specifications by orders of magnitude, capturing ultrafine particles that ordinary air purifiers miss entirely.</p>

                <h3>0.003 Micron Filtration</h3>
                <p>While standard HEPA filters capture 99.97% of particles down to 0.3 microns, HyperHEPA technology achieves the same efficiency at 0.003 microns - particles 100 times smaller. This exceptional capability captures viruses, bacteria fragments, combustion particles, and ultrafine pollution that penetrate standard filters.</p>

                <p>The difference matters profoundly for health. Ultrafine particles below 0.1 microns penetrate deep into lungs and enter the bloodstream, contributing to cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and systemic inflammation. HyperHEPA stops these dangerous particles that other purifiers allow through.</p>

                <h3>Certified Performance</h3>
                <p>Independent testing by third-party laboratories verifies IQAir's performance claims, unlike many competitors that cite theoretical specifications without validation. Every HealthPro Plus unit includes individual test results confirming filtration efficiency of its specific filters.</p>

                <h3>Medical and Industrial Applications</h3>
                <p>Hospitals, dental offices, laboratories, and clean rooms worldwide rely on IQAir technology, demonstrating the system's capabilities exceed consumer marketing hype. The same technology protecting medical procedures and sensitive manufacturing now guards your home's air quality.</p>

                <h2>Three-Stage Filtration System</h2>
                <p>The comprehensive filtration approach addresses particles, gases, and odors through specialized filter media optimized for different contaminants.</p>

                <h3>Stage 1: PreMax Pre-Filter</h3>
                <p>The large surface area pre-filter captures coarse particles like dust, pet hair, pollen, and mold spores, preventing them from reaching the HyperHEPA filter and extending its lifespan. The pleated design maximizes particle capture while maintaining airflow. The pre-filter handles typical household particulates efficiently.</p>

                <h3>Stage 2: V5-Cell Gas & Odor Filter</h3>
                <p>The activated carbon and chemisorbent media V5-Cell filter removes volatile organic compounds (VOCs), chemicals, gases, and odors that particle filters can't capture. This includes formaldehyde from furniture, paint fumes, cleaning product chemicals, cooking odors, pet odors, smoke, and outdoor pollution gases.</p>

                <p>The 5-pound carbon media provides exceptional adsorption capacity compared to the thin carbon pre-filters found in budget purifiers. This substantial media volume enables effective gas removal rather than merely masking odors.</p>

                <h3>Stage 3: HyperHEPA Filter</h3>
                <p>The HyperHEPA filter represents the heart of the system, with its intricate pleated design maximizing surface area while maintaining low airflow resistance. The sophisticated filter media captures particles through multiple mechanisms including interception, impaction, and diffusion, achieving unprecedented efficiency across all particle sizes.</p>

                <h2>Exceptional Room Coverage</h2>
                <p>The powerful yet efficient fan system delivers clean air throughout large rooms with multiple air changes per hour.</p>

                <h3>1,125 Square Feet Coverage</h3>
                <p>The HealthPro Plus effectively purifies rooms up to 1,125 square feet, making it suitable for master bedrooms, living rooms, open-concept spaces, and even small apartments. The substantial coverage eliminates the need for multiple units in typical homes.</p>

                <h3>High Air Change Rate</h3>
                <p>The system achieves 5+ air changes per hour in a 1,125 sq ft space, meaning all air passes through the filters every 12 minutes. This rapid turnover quickly removes newly introduced contaminants from cooking, cleaning, or outdoor air intrusion, maintaining consistently clean air.</p>

                <h2>WhisperQuiet Operation</h2>
                <p>Swiss engineering delivers powerful air cleaning with remarkably low noise levels across all fan speeds.</p>

                <h3>25-59 dB Range</h3>
                <p>At minimum speed, the HealthPro Plus operates at just 25 decibels - quieter than a whisper and virtually inaudible in bedrooms at night. Maximum speed reaches 59 dB, comparable to normal conversation and acceptable even in living areas. Most users run the unit at medium speeds of 35-45 dB, providing effective cleaning with minimal disruption.</p>

                <h3>Precision-Balanced Fan</h3>
                <p>The dynamically balanced EvenFlow Diffuser eliminates the vibration and hum common in inferior purifiers. The fan operates smoothly without rattle, buzz, or resonance at any speed, and the aerodynamic design minimizes turbulence that creates noise.</p>

                <h3>Night Mode</h3>
                <p>The dimmable control panel lighting turns off completely in night mode, preventing sleep disruption from LED glows. Many users report the gentle white noise at low speeds actually promotes better sleep.</p>

                <h2>Six-Speed Fan Control</h2>
                <p>Precise speed adjustment enables balancing cleaning power with noise preferences and energy efficiency.</p>

                <h3>Speed 1-2: Sleep Mode</h3>
                <p>The lowest speeds provide continuous gentle air circulation perfect for bedrooms and offices, operating nearly silently while maintaining air quality. These speeds work well for continuous operation in occupied spaces.</p>

                <h3>Speed 3-4: Normal Operation</h3>
                <p>Medium speeds handle typical daily air cleaning with balanced performance and noise levels suitable for living areas, home offices, and daytime bedroom use. These speeds efficiently process air without calling attention to themselves.</p>

                <h3>Speed 5-6: Maximum Cleaning</h3>
                <p>High speeds rapidly clean air after cooking, when returning from open windows, or during high outdoor pollution events. The maximum speed quickly processes large volumes of air, then the unit can return to quieter operation.</p>

                <h3>360-Degree Air Intake</h3>
                <p>The cylindrical design with all-around air intake maximizes filter surface area utilization and enables flexible placement. Position the unit against walls or in corners without blocking airflow - the omnidirectional intake always has clear paths.</p>

                <h3>Smooth-Rolling Casters</h3>
                <p>Four heavy-duty casters enable effortless repositioning between rooms despite the unit's 37-pound weight. Lock the casters to prevent movement during operation. Move the purifier to whichever room needs the most attention throughout the day.</p>

                <h2>Long Filter Life</h2>
                <p>The large filter capacity and efficient design result in exceptional filter longevity that reduces operating costs.</p>

                <h3>PreMax Filter: 18 Months</h3>
                <p>The pre-filter typically lasts 18 months under normal conditions before requiring replacement. The large surface area prevents rapid clogging, and the filter can be gently vacuumed to extend life further.</p>

                <h3>V5-Cell Filter: 2 Years</h3>
                <p>The gas and odor filter maintains effectiveness for approximately 2 years with typical use. Homes with heavy cooking, smoking, or chemical exposure may require more frequent replacement, while minimal-odor environments extend filter life.</p>
